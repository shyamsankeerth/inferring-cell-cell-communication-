# CROSSTALK WEBSERVER

**Inferring Cell-Cell Communication in Alzheimer's Brain Cells**
**Overview**
This project involves the development of a webserver that visualizes and analyzes cell-cell interactions in Alzheimer’s disease brain cells. The platform provides an interactive interface to explore molecular communication patterns, helping researchers understand the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.

The webserver is structured with a server-side processing module, a user-friendly UI, and an analytical pipeline to process and display cell interaction data effectively.

**Project Structure**
The repository is organized as follows:

📂 server/ – Contains backend scripts responsible for processing data, managing computations, and handling requests.
📂 ui/ – Houses the front-end components that provide an interactive dashboard for visualization.
📂 analysis/ – Includes scripts for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization of cell-cell interactions.
📂 data/ – Stores relevant datasets used for analysis.
📄 README.md – This file, explaining the project details.

**Key Features**
✔️ Visualization of Cell-Cell Interactions – Displays how brain cells communicate under Alzheimer’s disease conditions.
✔️ Interactive Webserver – Built to provide real-time insights through an intuitive UI dashboard.
✔️ Data Processing & Analysis – Uses bioinformatics pipelines to analyze multi-omics datasets.
✔️ Separation of Server & UI Components – Ensures modularity for easy updates and scalability.

**Technology Stack**
🔹 Backend: Python (Flask/Django), R Shiny
🔹 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
🔹 Data Analysis: R, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
🔹 Visualization: ggplot2, D3.js, Shiny dashboard
🔹 Bioinformatics Tools: Seurat, Scanpy, Bioconductor
